  Transmission BitTorrent client with all traffic routed through an OpenVPN
  tunnel for private, secure downloading. Based on haugene/transmission-openvpn.


  ## Features

  - All torrent traffic is routed through your VPN provider

  - Supports 30+ VPN providers (NordVPN, PIA, Mullvad, ProtonVPN, Surfshark, etc.)

  - Built-in kill switch — if the VPN drops, traffic stops

  - Health checks to ensure VPN connectivity

  - Web UI for managing torrents


  ## Radarr & Sonarr Integration

  This app is pre-configured to work with Radarr and Sonarr on your Umbrel.
  Downloads are saved to the shared `/downloads` directory so Radarr and Sonarr
  can automatically import completed files.


  When adding this as a download client in Radarr/Sonarr, use:

  - **Host:** `transmission-openvpn`

  - **Port:** `9091`

  - **No username/password required** (unless you set TRANSMISSION_RPC_USERNAME/PASSWORD)


  ## First-Time Setup

  SSH into your Umbrel, place your `.ovpn` file in the app's `data/openvpn/`
  directory, and set `OPENVPN_CONFIG` (and credentials if required) in
  `docker-compose.yml`. See the README for detailed instructions.
