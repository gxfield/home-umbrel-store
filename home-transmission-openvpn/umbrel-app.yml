description: >-
  Transmission BitTorrent client with all traffic routed through an OpenVPN
  tunnel for private, secure downloading. Based on haugene/transmission-openvpn.


  ## Features

  - All torrent traffic is routed through your VPN provider

  - Supports 30+ VPN providers (NordVPN, PIA, Mullvad, ProtonVPN, Surfshark, etc.)

  - Built-in kill switch — if the VPN drops, traffic stops

  - Health checks to ensure VPN connectivity

  - Web UI for managing torrents


  ## Radarr & Sonarr Integration

  This app is pre-configured to work with Radarr and Sonarr on your Umbrel.
  Downloads are saved to the shared `/downloads` directory so Radarr and Sonarr
  can automatically import completed files.


  When adding this as a download client in Radarr/Sonarr, use:

  - **Host:** `home-transmission-openvpn_transmission_1`

  - **Port:** `9091`

  - **No username/password required** (unless you set TRANSMISSION_RPC_USERNAME/PASSWORD)


  ## First-Time Setup

  After installing, you **must** SSH into your Umbrel and edit the environment
  variables in this app's docker-compose.yml to set your VPN provider,
  username, and password. Alternatively, you can mount a custom .ovpn file.


  See https://haugene.github.io/docker-transmission-openvpn/ for full
  documentation on supported providers and configuration options.
